—-Overview—

We have designed an online retail system for a store that sells various electronic products. Customers can buy goods or services directly from a seller over the Internet using a web browser when they shop online. Consumers identify a product of interest by visiting the retailer's website directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which compares the availability and cost of the same product across multiple e-retailers. To meet client needs, a corporation or firm must devote a significant amount of resources and labor. A retail management system can help with this, as well as be helpful to both sides equally. Retail management is a procedure that reviews all aspects of a retail sale in order to improve good outcomes. It is a set of methods and techniques used to improve the retail environment and structure in order to provide excellent customer service.


—-Purpose—-
Track orders and shipment.
Inventory and logistics management.
Database will be used by business and executive managers.
To analysis product’s popularity.




—-Installation—

The project scripts were designed for an RDMS database and were run on SQL Server Management Studio. Windows users can directly install SQL Server Management System from doc.microsoft.com. MacOS users need to run a Docker image and use it with Azure Data Studio to run the same.

Once the respective environments are setup, import the scripts from your local machine. Then, firstly execute the DDL files and later the data insertion files.



—-Scope:—-

The database's scope relates to the database's intended functionality. The database's basic table structure, linkages, and indexes are all dependent on the retail system platform's capability. Identifying the retail system's functionality is the most important concern while developing the database. Additional functions, in addition to order tracking and inventory/logistics management, are nice-to-have features for the retail management platform that improve the user experience for both end-users (customers) and administrators (the business). Marketing functions, help desk and support, complex analytics, and third-party connectors are among the additional features.
